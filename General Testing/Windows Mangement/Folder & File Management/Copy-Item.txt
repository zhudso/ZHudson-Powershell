Copying an item from a remote computer to your computer.

-------- Pre Reqs --------
#Requires Powershell 5.1 due to the command: -FromSession
On remote computer:
  Enable-PSRemoting -Force
  winrm set winrm/config/client  '@{TrustedHosts=""}' (optional from my limited experience, but might be required in some cases)
  Restart-Service WinRM (optional)
  Test-WsMan "RemoteCOMPUTERName"

-------- Process --------
$cred = Get-Credential
$sess = New-PSSession -Credential $cred -ComputerName "computer name"
Copy-Item "C:\Program Files (x86)\Softros Systems" -Destination $env:userprofile\desktop -Recurse -FromSession $Session

NOTE: -FromSession is important as it's what is able to store the information back to your computer.
